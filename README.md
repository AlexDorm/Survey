# The survey project

##Â Project overview

The goal of this project is to do a daily survey in different companies during a couple of month. Our problem is that every company won't allow us to install softwares on their computers. Therefore, we decided to develop on different platforms (chrome extension, applications...) that are lighter and will allow us to collect the data we need.

## Technical part

The different platforms we are using will be using the same database and back end server. We chose to use a tomcat server and develop the server answers with Servlet. Concerning the database, it is a MySQL one.
